# Exploring K-Means Clustering in Scikit-learn with Streamlit

This app lets you explore Scikit-learn's K-Means clustering algorithm. You can use your own dataset as a .csv file to perform the clustering, or you can use the dataset on an e-commerce store's customers, provided by me. If you choose to use your own data, rest assured that it won't be stored anywhere (you can inspect my source code here). 

You can choose how many dimensions to use for clustering (for the sake of plotting convenience, you can either choose 2 or 3 dimensions).

**Skills I've demonstrated here include**:
- Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering), 
- working with Scikit-learn, 
- working with Streamlit,
- applying the elbow method to select the number of clusters, 
- data visualization with Seaborn and Plotly.
